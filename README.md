### Global Trade. Made Clear.

Trvue empowers entrepreneurs and small businesses by removing friction from global trade. We believe clarity is the foundation of growth, and that small businesses deserve the same access, speed, and confidence in sourcing as the world’s biggest players. Trvue connects you with vetted suppliers, real‑time market insights, and meaningful partnerships that fuel long‑term growth.

#### Project structure

This repository organizes React pages and reusable components into a clean structure:

    src/
    ├── components/   # shared UI elements (e.g., Navbar)

You can add additional pages and components as your application grows.
